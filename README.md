# Heart-Disease-Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset encompassing a range of health indicators and risk factors associated with heart disease.
The dataset includes parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and exercise patterns. The goal of this analysis is to assess the risk of heart disease, identify potential trends, and support health research.

Tools and Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations to uncover insights.
Steps in the Analysis:
Data Overview and Cleaning:

Loaded the dataset and conducted an initial exploration of its structure.
Checked for and handled missing data to ensure a clean and reliable dataset for further analysis.
Demographic Analysis:

Analyzed demographic factors such as age and gender to understand their relationship with heart disease prevalence.
Key findings include:
Increasing Prevalence with Age: The risk of heart disease generally increases with age for both males and females, aligning with medical knowledge.
Higher Prevalence in Males: In most age groups, males exhibit a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to females.
Notable Differences in Specific Age Groups: Certain age groups, like the 45-55 range, show a more pronounced difference in prevalence between genders.
This analysis highlights the importance of demographic factors in heart disease risk, paving the way for more targeted health interventions and research. Visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn effectively communicate these insights.
